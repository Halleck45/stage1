Howdy!

Some time ago you signed up for Stage1's private beta. Today we are opening our
doors to our very private beta, for a very select few. Everything is still a bit
rough, but we are so excited about Stage1 that we want to share it right now,
and see what you will make out of it. We'd love to get feedback too.

So here's the deal, you get to use Stage1 for free for as long as we're in beta
(very private, private and public). In exchange, all we ask for is that you
actually use it, and give your most honest and detailed feedback.

Fair deal? Then jump in:

{{ url('app_core_beta_enter', { betaKey: beta.betaKey })}}

The very private beta will work best with Symfony2 projects, but if you're not
using Symfony2 and want to be in anyway, just reply to this email with your
requirements, we'll arrange something just for you.

Best regards,
