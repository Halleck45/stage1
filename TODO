TODO
====

* builds
    * build the right branch
    * fetch realtime build stdout
    * remove old running instance of a branch after a successful build
    * the build process must be completely error/fool proof
    * make the symfony builder a bit more clever
        * things that should work ootb
            * doctrine orm/odm
            * doctrine/alice fixtures
            * mysql/pgsql
            * mongodb/couchdb
            * redis/memcached
    * rename "top builds" to "running instances"?
    * also separate "pending builds", hence having 3 categories of builds (running instances, pending, others)?
    * disallow scheduling a build if a running instance for the same hash exists
    * allow shutting down a running instance
    * kill build should actually kill a build
    * encapsulate builds in a separate process than the consumer, so that it can be easily grepped and killed
    * separate builds and jobs

* projects
    * allow per-project docker image selection
        This should not be in the UI, it's an admin (as in, me) only feature for now
        This will be used for non-symfony alpha testers and to PoC the per-project-image thingy
    * setup webhook and deploy key on import
    * import should make ajax queries to stage1 instead of directly querying github
    * allow non-github projects (?)

* bi-directionnal communication
    * update web ui accordingly for the following events
        * build status change
        * number of builds running
        * new builds
        * new instance available
        * new project (detected through a build poke)

* admin
    * monitor all running docker container
    * ability to kill / top any running docker container
    * manually schedule builds for any project/branch

* misc UI
    * all "stateful buttons" should present an option to "retry" when failed
    * timeout long running ajax queries with a message like "uhoh, this is taking longer than expected"

THE DISTANT FUTURE
